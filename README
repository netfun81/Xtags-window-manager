XTags is a little keyboard-driven program which implements tags for X11.
It's a pseudo-WM called WHM (Window Helper Manager). The main goal is to
get rid of a "real" WM by using it with dvtm on the master tag and put
the secondary clients into the other tags.


* Installation

You only need to run the following command as root:

   # make clean install


* Usage

You can run XTags as a normal program if you don't have any Window
Manager (WM) running. Alternatively, put the following line into your
~/.xinitrc file and ensure that no other WMs are launched.

   exec xtags


* Support

It's possible to get support by posting into the xtags-users mailing
list. You should read the whole xtags(1) manual page before to ask
for help. Please, visit the official XTags web site at the following
URI: http://xtags.sf.net/.


Enjoy XTags!
