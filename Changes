Changes for XTags-0.5


. Fixed a bug on client_filter() about the XGetClassHint() function.
  Now it is checked for a zero value.

. Fixed a memory leak on client_filter() which didn't call XFree
  on res_class and res_name.

. Added the user function flyout() which switch to the given
  "selection layout" in order to get a view of all clients (if
  used with the new chess layout). See the LAYOUTS section and
  the flyout() function of the manual page for more informations.

. New layout chess. It is controlled by the CHESS_C4L preprocessor
  directive which set the number of clients for each line. Then the
  clients are just fit into the screen to groups of CHESS_C4L for
  each line.

. Added support for clients' labels. This allow to assign a one
  character label to each client (one for time) and then re-focus
  it by selecting that label. The idea born from a pancake's post
  on the dwm mailing list. Here is the related URI:

  This feature is not an improvement for the client_select() function
  but it's a new concept at all. So, both client_select() and the two
  client_label() and client_focus() routines will stay in upstream.

. Added the clients_kill() function which close all clients into the
  current tag.

. New macro SRUN() which uses SYNT_TOOL (default espeak) with the
  options specified by the SYNT_OPTS directive, in order to play
  a vocal synthesizer before spawn.

. Improved and updated the man page.

. Other minor changes, fixes, impromevents and code cleanup.
